Core Functionality
==================

A core functionality plugin for WordPress to be used on client sites. It does a whole bunch of things.

Thanks to the following people, who I'd either adapted code from or used ideas from in the making of this plugin:

* [Bill Erickson](http://www.billerickson.net/core-functionality-plugin/)
* [Andrea Whitmer](http://www.nutsandboltsmedia.com/how-to-create-a-custom-functionality-plugin-and-why-you-need-one/)

And here's a [blog post](http://redblue.us/2014/07/writing-my-core-functionality-plugin/) about what I'm trying to accomplish here.
